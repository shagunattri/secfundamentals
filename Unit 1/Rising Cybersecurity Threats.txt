The big rising threats for this year include:
Ransomware – Computing devices are locked and encrypted, usually through a clicked link
or installed malware.
The users are threatened, if they don’t pay, by a certain time, files will start to
be deleted.
Paying for the decryption key encourages ransomware artists to continue,
funds future activities of these adversaries,
and doesn’t even guarantee that a key will be sent,
or if sent will even work.
An IBM Study reported 4,000 ransomware attacks were unleashed each day of 2016,
more than four times the number in 2015.
This is expected to rise even more in 2017.
Integrity – Sabotaging data is also being hailed as a major source of cybersecurity
problems in 2017.
Hackers, while they certainly have gone after the confidentiality in a prolific rate the
last few years,
will now throw doubt and confusion into the accuracy and reliability of information,
affecting decisions made in both the public and private sectors.
Data will be changed.
Cyberattacks involving integrity won’t necessarily be after a specific company,
but will be done to just eliminate any form of trust.
People won’t know what’s real and what’s fake anymore.
The stock market, banks, laboratories, and lots of publicly traded companies therefore
have much to lose.
Accounts will be added to systems.
How can you determine if an account is a rogue account part of an attack, or a legitimate
one?
How can you keep an attacker from observing your network,
if he has a legitimate (self-created) account on the network?
Attackers spend hundreds of days undetected inside of networks as it is right now.
Integrity attacks could make it years of not being detected or in some cases, hackers could
stay in networks indefinitely!

>> A certificate authority or CA is a corporation that issues digital certificates.
An individual doing banking online would surely want to use encryption.
That person certainly doesn't want his or her identity stolen.
An organization like Citibank wants to use encryption, too.
Their motivation is more along the lines of not wanting to get sued.
Citibank will look to a CA to be their digital notary public.
A CA is a trusted third party.
Both Citibank and its customers need to trust CA for the system to work.
Symantec, Comodo, and GoDaddy are the top three certificate authorities today.
First, the CA makes sure that the company is legit.
Because if the CA authenticates a company that proves
to be nefarious, the CA's reputation is at stake.
In our story, Citibank gives the CA their public key but keeps their private key secret.
The CA constructs a digital certificate, signs it, and gives it to Citibank
to put in the root of their web server.
When a customer goes to the bank's website,
Citibank presents this digital certificate to the customer.

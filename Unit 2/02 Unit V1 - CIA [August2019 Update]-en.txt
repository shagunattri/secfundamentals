>> The CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, is the United States Service that gathers, processes,
and analyzes national security information from around the world.
How fitting that we can use the letters differently to represent the CIA model,
which describes three important goals for cybersecurity.
The C stands for confidentiality.
Cybersecurity requires privacy in data and information.
Certain people, devices, or processes should be permitted or restricted from seeing data, files,
and items, like username, password combinations.
Confidentiality is concerned with simply viewing data or information.
If the wrong people see data or information,
and they're not authorized, many problems could arise.
Company secrets, source code,
personal identifiable information and more, should be safeguarded.
The main way confidentiality is accomplished is through encryption,
which we'll cover in a future module.
The I in this CIA model stands for integrity.
Cybersecurity requires us to feel safe that data transmitted, processed,
and stored has not been changed from its original form,
either accidentally or maliciously.
If one bit of a message is changed, the whole message could change!
The difference between the words, hired and fired, that's one character!
But those words mean very different things.
Furthermore, the whole message itself could be corrupted and unreadable.
The main way integrity is accomplished is through hashing,
which we'll also cover in a future module.
The last letter of CIA, the A, stands for availability.
With all your cyber security measures in place, dealing with hardware, software, people,
processes, and more, users who are authorized to do their jobs should be able to do so.
You want to make sure that you don't fall victim to a
distributed denial of service, DDos, attack
and that you have full tolerance and load balancing
in the event of a cybersecurity incident or disaster.

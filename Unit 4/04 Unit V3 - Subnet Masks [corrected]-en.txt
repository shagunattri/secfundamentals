>> Let's take a look at how subnet masks are used.
We'll also explore why both physical MAC addresses
and logical IP addresses are always needed for communication.
Let's do all of that with a couple of stories.
In story number one, host A with IP address 10.10.1.1 wants to communicate
with host B whose IP address is 10.10.1.2.
The source of the traffic will take its IP address in subnet mask
and perform a boolean and operation.
All 32 bits of the IP address are lined up with the 32 bits of the subnet mask.
In this case, the subnet mask of the source 10.10.1.1 is 255.255.255.0 in base 10.
In binary, it looks like 24 ones followed by 8 zeros.
This means that the first 24 of the 32 bits are network bits
and are shared by every device on this network.
The last eight bits are host bits and are unique in entirety to each host on this network.
Each of the four base 10 numbers is known as an octet
because each number is represented by eight bits in binary.
Subnet masks can span multiple octets and need not be contained to a multiple of eight bits.
For example, instead of 255.255.255.0, the mask could have been 255.255.255.192
where the first 26 bits are network bits and the last six bits are host bits.
When the host logically ends each of the 32 columns bringing down a 1 if both bits
in the column are ones and bringing down a zero if the two bits in a column are not both ones,
what results is what we call a network identifier.
In this case, the source's network identifier is 10.10.1.0.
No matter how many host bits are in an IP address, if they are all zeros
that represents a network ID and cannot be assigned to a host.
In this case, there are eight host bits and they can't all be zeros because the IP address
with all host bits set to zero represents the network ID.
In fact, they can't be all ones either because when all host bits are set to one
that represents a network broadcast address and, like a network ID, cannot be assigned to hosts.
This network's broadcast address with all host bits set to one would be 10.10.1.255.
Any pattern besides all zeros and all ones for the host bits, that's legal and valid
to be assigned to devices on the network.
Now the source needs to determine if the destination is on the same network
or a different one by performing a second boolean and operation.
The source takes the destination IP address and logically ends it
with the sources own subnet mask.
The destination's subnet mask is unknown and it is never transmitted.
The destination's IP address is either known by the source or resolved
from its name using a protocol we'll explore in a future module called DNS, domain name system.
The source doesn't actually need the destination's mask because if they are
on the same network their subnet masks will be the same anyway.
After logically ending the destination IP address of 10.10.1.2 with the source mask
of 255.255.255.0, the resultant network ID matches the network ID of the source 10.10.1.0.
This lets the source know that the destination is on the same network
and traffic can be delivered directly.

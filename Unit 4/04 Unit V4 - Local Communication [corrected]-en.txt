>> After determining that the traffic is local,
the source needs the MAC address of the destination.
The source puts the actual traffic on hold and sends
out a broadcast message using a protocol known as ARP, address resolution protocol.
ARP is meant to resolve a known IP address to the MAC address that it is bound to in software.
The message in the ARP request explains that host A 10.10.1.1 is looking
for them MAC address of 10.10.1.2.
All devices on the network not only see this ARP request but they read it as well.
Every device but the actual destination says that's not for me and discards it.
Host B 10.10.1.2 sends an ARP reply back to host A 10.10.1.1.
The ARP reply is unicast, which means it only goes to 10.10.1.1
and is not broadcasted to everyone on the network.
In the ARP request, the source listed its MAC address so the destination didn't need
to broadcast to find out the sources MAC address.
Broadcast on networks are bad.
Hosts have to interrupt what they're doing and parse through the broadcast
and most cases realize that it's not even meant for them.
It's like a professor e-mailing a 500 page PDF to the class with the subject line read this
and the name of a single student who it was meant for appearing on page 499.
Unfortunately, in the world of IPv4, there is no other way to do this.
After the ARP reply comes back to host A with host B's MAC address,
host A can now fill-in the destination's MAC address and send the traffic.
The source and destination MAC addresses are two of the fields found
in the layer 2 frame while the source
and destination IP addresses are a couple of the fields in the IP packet.

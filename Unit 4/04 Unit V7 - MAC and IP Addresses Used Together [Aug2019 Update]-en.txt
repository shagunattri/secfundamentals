>> As illustrated, MAC addresses are only locally significant and are definitely needed
in addition to IP addresses to specify the next hop to receive the packet
and route to its final destination.
Every time a packet passes through an interface, the frame is stripped off and discarded
and after the next router figures out the next hop,
the packet is reframed with a new outer frame.
IP addresses are logical and for the most part geographical and hierarchical like zip codes.
If I send a UPS package from Rochester to Staten Island,
the first UPS distribution center sends it to the next one.
And the second distribution center sends it to the third.
The tracking of packages is made possible with UPS routing stickers slapped
on the UPS packages going out of each distribution facility to the next facility.
Think of those as the MAC addresses.
As a package leaves a UPS distribution center, the sticker indicates
which distribution center it's leaving and which distribution center it's destined for.
When it gets to the next distribution center, those stickers are removed.
That's just like the Ethernet frames in our networking story, which are removed
and added back with each router that a packet passes through.
However, on that brown box are to and from addresses which represent the actual person
and source location sending the package and the actual person
and destination that the package is meant for.
Those are of course analogous to the source and destination IP addresses in our story.
The IP addresses just like the to and from addresses are geographical and never change
through the duration of the path the packet or package takes to the final destination.

>> Recently, a new family -- the Smiths -- moved into a house on our street.
My wife made them a Welcome package with fruits and goodies and asked me to deliver it to them.
A few new houses on the block were sold recently and I wasn't exactly sure
which house the Smiths moved into.
Late one night, I went to my porch and shouted, "Hey, Bob Smith,
which house did you guys move into?"
In the process, I woke up the whole neighborhood, including our two kids.
However, I did in fact get Bob's attention and he very discreetly walked to my doorstep
and said, "Hey Jonathan, it's 123 Main Street."
Then he walked home.
Later that night I brought the package over to the Smiths.
Also recently, our kids made art projects at school for their grandparents --
my parents, who live in Staten Island, New York, and my in-laws, who live in Philly.
I didn't want to drive six hours to Staten Island or Philly from Rochester just
to deliver the works of art, so I Googled for the nearest UPS store to our house.
I brought the packages of art there, paid for them, and went home.
The magical world of networking uses the same logic.
Computing devices directly deliver messages for other devices
on the same network through switches.
Switches connect devices of the same network together.
However, computing devices rely on a router to communicate with devices on different networks.
We'll see exactly how routers and switches work in a future module.
But for now, all you need to know is that switches connect devices
of the same network together and routers connect different networks together.
